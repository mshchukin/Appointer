# Appointer
A simple calendar based appointment scheduling system created by Mitchell Steffensen, Brooke Clary, Oles Shnurovskyy, Mikhail Shchukin, Laura Teigrob, and Shelby Piechotta.

## Setup
* Extract all files to web server directory
* Import 'database.sql' on your MySQL server
* Update 'config.php' with the appropriate MySQL details
* Profit!

## Notes
* Appointer is set to UTC by default, so the calendar dates and times may not be the same as your own
* The database is pre-populated with several example users, appointments and meetings
    * The password for all pre-populated users is "test1234567"
